## 1.5 Overview

This document is organized into several sections that describe the overall system, functional requirements, non-functional requirements, and other considerations relevant to the development and implementation of the Google Docs clone application.

## 2. Overall Description

## 2.1 Product Perspective

The Google Docs clone application is a standalone web-based system designed for document creation and real-time collaboration. It will interface with external systems for cloud storage and authentication services. The system will use a modular architecture to enhance scalability and maintainability.

## 2.2 Product Functions

- *Document Creation and Editing*: Users can create and edit documents with a rich text editor.
- *Real-Time Collaboration*: Multiple users can collaborate on a document simultaneously with live updates.
- *Document Sharing and Permissions*: Users can share documents with different access levels.
- *Version History*: Users can view and revert to previous versions of a document.
- *Commenting and Suggestions*: Users can leave comments and make suggestions on documents.
- ## 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics

- *End Users*: Individuals using the application to create, edit, and collaborate on documents.
- *Administrators*: Users managing the platform, including user permissions and document access.
- *Developers*: Technical staff responsible for maintaining and enhancing the application.

## 2.4 Operating Environment

The application will operate on major web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and will be compatible with both desktop and mobile devices. It requires an internet connection for full functionality, particularly for real-time collaboration and document sharing. Backend services will be hosted on cloud infrastructure for high availability and performance.

## 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints

- *Data Protection*: The application must comply with data protection regulations such as GDPR and CCPA.
- *Browser Compatibility*: The application must be tested and optimized for compatibility with major web browsers.
- *Performance*: The application must handle multiple concurrent users and large documents efficiently.

## 2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies

- Users have access to modern web browsers and stable internet connections.
- Integration with cloud storage and authentication services is reliable and secure.
- The application will initially support only one language (e.g., English) and one currency (e.g., USD).

## 3. System Features

## 3.1 Document Creation and Editing

*Description*: Users can create and edit text documents using a rich text editor.

- The system shall provide basic text formatting options including font style, size, and color.
- The system shall support the insertion of images, tables, and hyperlinks.
- The system shall auto-save documents to prevent data loss.

## 3.2 Real-Time Collaboration

*Description*: Multiple users can edit the same document simultaneously with live updates.

*Functional Requirements*:

- The system shall enable real-time synchronization of changes made by multiple users.
- The system shall display presence indicators showing who is currently editing the document.
- The system shall handle simultaneous edits efficiently without data conflicts.

## 3.3 Document Sharing and Permissions

*Description*: Users can share documents and manage access permissions.

*Functional Requirements*:

- The system shall provide options to share documents via email or direct links.
- The system shall allow users to set access permissions (view, comment, edit) for collaborators.
- The system shall support both public and private sharing settings.
